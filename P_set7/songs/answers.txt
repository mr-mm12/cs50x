I think one way would be to see which singers he
listens to the most, because usually a singer sings
a specific style of music, like classical or pop.
We can determine what the user's vocal aura is by
considering the name of the singer and the style of music they sing.


This idea may not be very accurate because a singer
may sing more than 1 style of music or the user may
be interested in multiple genres of music.
